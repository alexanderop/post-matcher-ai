# Advanced Types in TypeScript

TypeScript offers advanced types such as union, intersection, and mapped types. These features enable developers to write expressive and type-safe code.

## Examples

- Union types: `string | number`
- Intersection types: `A & B`
- Mapped types: `{ [K in Keys]: Type }`

Understanding these types can help you write more robust TypeScript code.
