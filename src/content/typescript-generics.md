# Generics in TypeScript

Generics allow you to write flexible, reusable functions and classes in TypeScript. They enable type-safe code while maintaining flexibility.

## Example

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}
```

Generics are a powerful feature for building robust TypeScript libraries and applications.
