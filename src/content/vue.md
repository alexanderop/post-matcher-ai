# Introduction to Vue.js

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications. Its core library focuses on the view layer only, making it easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects.

## Why Choose Vue?

- **Simplicity:** Vue's API is straightforward and easy to learn, making it accessible for beginners and powerful for experienced developers.
- **Reactivity:** Vue uses a reactive data-binding system, ensuring your UI stays in sync with your data.
- **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to create complex UIs.
- **Great Tooling:** Vue offers a rich ecosystem, including Vue CLI, Vue Router, and Vuex for state management.

## Getting Started Example

Here's a simple example of a Vue component:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
    <button @click="reverseMessage">Reverse Message</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello Vue!'
    }
  },
  methods: {
    reverseMessage() {
      this.message = this.message.split('').reverse().join('')
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
